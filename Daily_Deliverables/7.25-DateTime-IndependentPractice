//Independent Practice
//Create some dates in Javascript.

var d1 = new Date(1999,5,20);
var d21 = new Date(2018,0,11);

//Create your Birthday

var birthday = new Date(1990, 3, 29);

console.log(birthday);

//Can you format/print a date in different formats?

var birthday = new Date(1990, 3, 29);

console.log(birthday);
console.log(birthday.getFullYear());
console.log(birthday.getDate());
console.log(birthday.getTime());

//Explain the "epoch time" to a friend. Why do you think "epoch time is useful?
//Unix epoch, or epoch time is an expression in seconds since 1/1/1970. It allows us to mathematically compare dates.

//Learn about other ways of working with dates
//Look at Moment.js documentation

//Challenge
//If you add (date1 + date2) or subtract (date1 - date2) two dates in Javascript, it returns the time difference in milliseconds. Can you write a function to subtract two dates but return the time difference in minutes? What about as a date object?

let date1 = new Date(2010,0,1);
let date2 = new Date(2019,0,1);

console.log(date1.getMinutes() - date2.getMinutes());
