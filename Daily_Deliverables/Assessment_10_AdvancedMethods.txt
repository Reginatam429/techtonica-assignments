2.Recursion
 Paste an example of recursion here, and explain what is happening in the code:
 
 isPalindrome = (aString) => {
    //base case #1
    if(aString.length === 0 || aString.length === 1) return true;
    //base case #2 - to determine if it is not a palindrome
    if(aString[0] !== aString[aString.length -1]) return false;

    return isPalindrome(aString.substr(1, aString.length -2))

}
    In this code, we have a base case that tells us when to stop the recursive case. The base case is if the string is 0-1 letters long, then it will return true and end the recursion. 
    In our recursive case, we are telling the function to use sub.str to give us the text between two letters in and 2 letters from the end of the string. This allows us to compare the string we have returned in each succession of the recursion to check against the base cases.
